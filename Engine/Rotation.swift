 A 2x2 matrix contains 4 numbers, hence the four parameters. The `m[x]` naming is conventional, but unless you
 are well-versed with linear algebra those parameters won't mean a whole lot. Let's add an initializer with
 slightly more ergonomic parameters:
 
 This initializer takes the sine and cosine of a given angle and produces a matrix representing a rotation
 by that angle. We already said that we can't (easily) use the `sin` and `cos` functions inside the engine itself,
 but that's OK because we'll we be doing that part in the platform layer.

/**
 Finally, we'll add a function to apply the rotation to a vector. This feels most natural to write as an
 extension method on `Vector` itself, but we'll put that extension in the `Rotation.swift` file because it makes
 more sense from a grouping perspective.
