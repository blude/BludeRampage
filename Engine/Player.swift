 We'll pass the Y component of the joystick `inputVector` as the speed, and use the X component to calculate the rotation.
 
 As you may recall from Part 2, the input velocity's magnitude ranges from 0 to 1, measured in world-units per second. On the engine side we multiply this by the player's maximum speed and the `timeStep` value before adding it to the position each frame.

 If we treat the X component as a rotational velocity value, it becomes radians per second rather than world units. This will also need to be multiplied by the time-step and a maximum turning speed, so let's add a `turningSpeed` property to `Player`:

 We've chosen a value of `pi` radians (180 degrees) for the turning speed, which means the player will be able to turn a full revolution in two seconds.

 Because we are fudging things a little by doing the trigonometry in the platform layer, we'll need to multiply the rotation by the `timeStep` and `turningSpeed` on the platform layer side instead of in `World.update()` as we did for the velocity. This is a bit inelegant, but still preferable to writing our own `sin` and `cos` functions.
